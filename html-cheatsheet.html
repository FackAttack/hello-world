    <h1>Fack's Cheat Sheet</h1>
    <p>^^ that was a h1 heading</p>

    <h2>This is a h2 heading</h2>
      <p>They can be good subtitles</p>

      <br>

      <p>I just put a space in my cheat sheet using the tag "br". You don't need to close this tag.</p>

      <p>I can also hyperlink to my <a href="https://www.the-pool.com">The Pool</a>, which is one of my all-time favourite sites.</p>
